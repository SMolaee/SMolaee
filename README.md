# 👩‍🔬 Seyedeh Z. Molaeezade
**PhD Candidate in Psychology at UPV/EHU**  
Specializing in Neurotherapy, Emotion Regulation

---

🎓 I'm Seyedeh Z. Molaeezadeh, a PhD candidate at the Universidad de pais Vasco (UPV/EHU), where my research is focused on clinical psychology and neurotherapy.  
I am deeply interested in exploring how neurofeedback (NF) and transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) impact psychological and neurophysiological states, such as anxiety, depression, and stress regulation.

---

## 🧠 Research Interests
- Clinical applications of neurofeedback and tVNS
- Emotional regulation, anxiety & depression subtypes
- Predicting response in neurotrapy with ML
- Cortisol and neuroendocrine markers of stress
- Development of Python tools for neuropsychological data visualization

---

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

📊 I'm currently developing a series of small, research-driven Python scripts to:
- Analyze data from neurofeedback and tVNS interventions
- Visualize multidimensional outcomes with elegant radar plots, heatmaps, and bar charts
- Automate processing of clinical scales (e.g., BAI, MCMI-IV)  
- Integrate EEG metrics with psychological results for personalized insight

🧪 These tools are designed for researchers, clinicians, and students interested in evidence-based neurotherapy.

## 🧬 Recent Work

Some of the topics and visual tools I’m exploring:
- 📉 Comparison of psychological measures across treatment groups
- 🧠 Visualization of Alpha/Theta ratio changes post-intervention
- 📘 Integration of Pydantic and FastAPI for clean backend validation
- 🧪 Data-driven case studies in clinical psychology research
