# 👩‍🔬 Seyedeh Z. Molaeezade
**PhD Candidate in Clinical Psychology at UPV**  
Specializing in Neurotherapy, Neurofeedback, and tVNS

---

🎓 I'm **Seyedeh Z. Molaeezade**, a PhD candidate at the **Universidad de pais Vasco (UPV/EHU)**, where my research is focused on **clinical psychology and neurotherapy**.  
I am deeply interested in exploring how **neurofeedback (NF)** and **transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS)** impact psychological and neurophysiological states, such as anxiety, depression, and stress regulation.

---

## 🧠 Research Interests
- Clinical applications of **neurofeedback** and **tVNS**
- Emotional regulation, anxiety & depression subtypes
- Quantitative EEG analysis (Alpha/Theta ratio)
- Cortisol and neuroendocrine markers of stress
- Development of **Python tools** for neuropsychological data visualization

---

## 🛠️ What I’m Working On

📊 I'm currently developing a series of **small, research-driven Python scripts** to:
- Analyze data from **neurofeedback** and **tVNS interventions**
- Visualize multidimensional outcomes with elegant **radar plots**, heatmaps, and bar charts
- Automate processing of **clinical scales (e.g., BAI, MCMI-IV)**  
- Integrate **EEG metrics** with psychological results for personalized insight

🧪 These tools are designed for researchers, clinicians, and students interested in **evidence-based neurotherapy**.

## 🧬 Recent Work

Some of the topics and visual tools I’m exploring:
- 📉 Comparison of psychological measures across treatment groups
- 🧠 Visualization of **Alpha/Theta ratio** changes post-intervention
- 📘 Integration of **Pydantic** and FastAPI for clean backend validation
- 🧪 Data-driven case studies in **clinical psychology research**
